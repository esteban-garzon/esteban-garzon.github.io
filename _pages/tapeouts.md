  <h4>RISC-V-based Research Platform in 65nm</h4>
	* Joint design with EnICS Laboratories, Bar-Ilan University, Israel
	* Chip Name: LEO-I
	* Role: backend designer (entire SoC integration)
	* Description: A novel platform for bringing a project from the concept to the tapeout stage in a short
amount of time. An open-source and extendable RISC-V architecture is exploited to build a small area
footprint core. This leads the research platform to be flexible in terms of design integration, while also
allowing fast design cycles of research chips.
