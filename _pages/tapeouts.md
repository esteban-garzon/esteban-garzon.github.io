  <ul>
    <li>Joint design with EnICS Laboratories, Bar-Ilan University, Israel</li>
    <li><strong>Chip Name:</strong> LEO-I</li>
    <li><strong>Role:</strong> backend designer (entire SoC integration)</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Description:</strong> A novel platform for bringing a project from the concept to the tapeout stage in a short
      amount of time. An open-source and extendable RISC-V architecture is exploited to build a small area
      footprint core. This leads the research platform to be flexible in terms of design integration, while also
      allowing fast design cycles of research chips.
