  abstract: "Real-time genome detection, classification and lineage assignment are critical for efficient tracking of emerging mutations and variants during viral pandemics such as Covid-19. For genomic surveillance to work effectively, each new viral genome sequence must be quickly and accurately associated with an existing viral family (lineage). 
  ViRAL is a hardware-accelerated platform for real-time viral genome lineage assignment based on minhashing and Vision Transformer.  Minhashing is a locality sensitive hashing based technique for finding regions of similarity within sequenced genomes. Vision Transformer is a model for image classification that employs a Transformer-like architecture over patches of images. In ViRAL, such image patches are genome 
  fragments extracted from the regions of high similarity. ViRAL is especially efficient in lineage assignment of extremely low quality (or highly ambiguous) genomic data, i.e. when a large fraction of DNA bases are missing in an assembled genome. We implement ViRAL on CPU, GPU and a custom-designed hardware accelerator denoted ACMI. ViRAL assigns newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes to existing lineages with the top-1 accuracy of 94.2%. The probability of the correct assignment to be found 
    among the five most likely placements generated by ViRAL (top-5 accuracy) is 99.8%. Accelerated ViRAL outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art assignment tools by 69.4X. It also outperforms ViRAL GPU implementation by 19.5X. ViRAL strongly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in 
    assigning highly-ambiguous genomes: while state-of-the-art tools fail to assign lineage to genomes with 50% ambiguity, ViRAL achieves 77.6% assignment accuracy. We make ViRAL available to the research community through GitHub."

  abstract: "Content addressable memories (CAMs) are widely used in many applications in general purpose computer microarchitecture, networking and domain-specific hardware accelerators. In addition to storing and reading data, CAMs enable simultaneous compare of query datawords with the entire memory content. Similar to SRAM and DRAM, CAMs are prone to errors and faults. While error correcting codes (ECCs) are widely used in DRAM and SRAM, they are not directly applicable in CAM: if a dataword that is supposed to match a query altered due to an error, it will falsely mismatch even if it is ECC-encoded. We propose OCCAM, an error oblivious CAM, which combines ECC and approximate search (matching) to allow tolerating a large and dynamically configurable number of errors. We manufactured the OCCAM silicon prototype using 65-nm commercial process and verified its error tolerance capabilities through silicon measurements. OCCAM tolerates 11% error rate (7 bit errors in each 64-bit memory row) with 100% sensitivity and specificity."

  abstract: "Associative access is widely used in fundamental microarchitectural components, such as caches and TLBs. However, associative (or content addressable) memories (CAMs) have been traditionally considered too large, too energy-hungry, and not scalable, and therefore, have limited use in modern computer microarchitecture. This work revisits these presumptions and proposes an energy-efficient fully-associative tag array (FASTA) architecture, based on a novel complementary CAM (CCAM) bitcell. CCAM offers a full CMOS solution for CAM, removing the need for time- and energy-consuming precharge and combining the speed of NOR CAM and low energy consumption of NAND CAM. While providing better performance and energy consumption, CCAM features a larger area compared to state-of-the-art CAM designs. We further show how FASTA can be used to construct a novel aliasing-free, energy-efficient, Very-Many-Way Associative (VMWA) cache. Circuit-level simulations using 16 nm FinFET technology show that a 128 kB FASTA-based 256-way 8-set associative cache is 28% faster and consumes 88% less energy-per-access than a same sized 8-way (256-set) SRAM based cache, while also providing aliasing-free operation. System-level evaluation performed on the Sniper simulator shows that the VMWA cache exhibits lower Misses Per Kilo Instructions (MPKI) for the majority of benchmarks. Specifically, the 256-way associative cache achieves 17.3%, 11.5%, and 1.2% lower average MPKI for L1, L2, and L3 caches, respectively, compared to a 16-way associative cache. The average IPC improvement for L1, L2, and L3 caches are 1.6%, 1.4%, and 0.2%, respectively."

One of the key emerging technologies that promises to enable such computing-in-memory is spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel junction (STT-MTJ). This paper proposes AM4, a combined STT-MTJ-based Content Addressable Memory (CAM), Ternary CAM (TCAM), approximate matching (similarity search) CAM (ACAM), and in-memory Associative Processor (AP) design, inspired by the recently announced Samsung MRAM crossbar. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance and energy-efficiency of the AM4-based AP using a variety of data intensive workloads. We show that an AM4-based AP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions both in performance (with the average speedup of about 10X) and energy-efficiency (by about 60X on average)."

More specifically, the latter is enhanced by incorporating additional circuitry to enhance the reliability of preliminary read operations. In this study, the proposed architecture is benchmarked against its conventional counterpart. Obtained results show a significant improvement in terms of reliability, i.e., the nominal read margin (RM) by a factor of about 3−4X and accordingly the bit error rate (BER) by more than four orders of magnitude. These improvements come at minimal cost in terms of circuit area and complexity compared to the conventional SIMPLY design. Overall, this research establishes SIMPLY+ as a promising solution for the design of reliable and energy-efficient in-memory computing architectures."

  abstract: "Multi-ported memories are widely used in many applications, such as for high-speed and high-performance parallel computations. While conventional SRAM-based memory macros are limited in both flexibility (e.g., to accommodate a large number of write inputs and read outputs) and performance, standard cell-based memories are much more flexible and can be parameterized. The physical implementation approaches of the existing tools have great difficulty in dealing with these memories due to the multiplicity of wiring and misunderstanding of the regular structure of these arrays, to the point of inability to converge under certain conditions. This paper presents novel methodologies for the logical and physical implementation of many-ported standard cell memories (MPSCMs). Two methodologies are proposed to replace the standard design flow by controlling and guiding the design tools to improve power consumption, area and performance of these arrays. A commercial 65 nm CMOS technology was used to evaluate and benchmark the two design methodologies on MPSCM macros of different sizes as compared to other equivalent macros designed with standard methodologies and state-of-the-art designs. Physical implementation results show that as compared to a standard RTL approach, the implementation of a 3-write, 5-read port (3W5R) register file with the tightly-controlled methodology leads a 2X increase in placement density along with significant reductions in write power (–66%), read power (–37%) and leakage power (–80%), while also improving the access time (–6%). When considering an extreme case of a many-ported memory with 20-write and 20-read ports (20W/20R), the guided methodology leads to improvements in delay (–13%), write power (–62%), and leakage power (–51%). Both methodologies were implemented within an automation utility based on the “Salamandra” open source netlisting tool, enabling fast and easy migration to additional process nodes and standard cell libraries for generating MPSCMs with various sizes and features."

  abstract: "Content-addressable memory (CAM) has been part of the memory market for more than five decades. CAM can carry out a single clock cycle lookup based on the content rather than an address. Thanks to this attractive feature, CAM is utilized in memory systems where a high-speed content lookup technique is required. However, typical CAM applications only support exact matching, as opposed to approximate matching, where a certain Hamming distance (several mismatching characters between a query pattern and the dataset stored in CAM) needs to be tolerated. Recent interest in approximate search has led to the development of new CAM-based alternatives, accelerating the processing of large data workloads in the realm of big data, genomics, and other data-intensive applications. In this review, we provide an overview of approximate CAM and describe its current and potential applications that would benefit from approximate search computing."

Finally, the sensor back-end translates such frequency ratio into the digital temperature code. Thanks to its low-complexity architecture, the proposed design achieves a very compact footprint along with low-power consumption and high accuracy in a wide temperature range. Moreover, thanks to a simple embedded line regulation mechanism, our sensor supports voltage-scalability.

  abstract: "Miniaturization and portable devices have reshaped the electronic device landscape, emphasizing the importance of high performance while maintaining energy efficiency to ensure long battery life. FinFET and Tunnel-FET technologies have emerged as attractive alternatives to overcome the limitations of supply voltage scaling for ultra-low power applications. This work compares the performance of 10 nm FinFET- and TFET-based digital circuits from basic logic gates up to an 8k gates low-power microprocessor. When compared with their FinFET-based counterparts, the TFET-based logic gates have lower leakage power when operated below 300 mV, show higher input capacitance, and exhibit a reduced propagation delay under different fan-in and fan-out conditions. Our comparative study was extended to the synthesis of an MSP-430 microprocessor through standard cell libraries built particularly for this work. It is demonstrated that the TFET-based synthesized circuits operating at ultra-low voltages achieve a higher performance in terms of speed at the cost of increased power consumption. When the speed requirements are relaxed, the TFET-based designs are the most energy-efficient alternative. It is concluded that the TFET is an optimal solution for ultra-low voltage design."

Our study is carried out through a macrospin-based Verilog-A compact model of DMTJ, along with a 65 nm commercial process design kit (PDK) calibrated down to 77 K under silicon measurements. Comprehensive bitcell-level electrical characterization is used to estimate the energy/latency per operation and leakage power at the memory architecture-level. As a main result of our analysis, we show that energy-efficient small-to-large embedded memories can be obtained by significantly relaxing the non-volatility requirement of DMTJ devices at room temperature (i.e., by reducing the cross-section area), while maintaining the typical 10-years retention time at cryogenic temperatures. This makes DMTJ-based STT-MRAM operating at 77 K more energy-efficient than six-transistors static random-access memory (6T-SRAM) under both read and write accesses (−56% and −37% on average, respectively). Obtained results thus prove that DMTJ-based STT-MRAM with relaxed retention time is a promising alternative for the realization of reliable and energy-efficient embedded memories operating at cryogenic temperatures."

  abstract: "The ever-growing interest in cryogenic applications has prompted the investigation for energy-efficient and high-density memory technologies that are able to operate efficiently at extremely low temperatures. This work analyzes three appealing embedded memory technologies under cooling—from room temperature (300 K) down to cryogenic levels (77 K). As the temperature goes down to 77 K, six-transistor static random-access memory (6T-SRAM) presents slight improvements for static noise margin (SNM) during hold and read operations, while suffering from lower (−16%) write SNM. Gain-cell embedded DRAM (GC-eDRAM) shows significant benefits under these conditions, with read voltage margins and data retention time improved by about 2× and 900×, respectively. Non-volatile spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) based on single- or double-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) exhibit higher read voltage sensing margins (36% and 48%, respectively), at the cost of longer write access time (1.45X and 2.1X, respectively). The above characteristics make the considered memory technologies to be attractive candidates not only for high-performance computing, but also enable the possibility to bridge the gap from room-temperature to the realm of cryogenic applications that operate down to liquid helium temperatures and below."

  abstract: "Operating circuits under cryogenic conditions is effective for a large spectrum of applications. However, the refrigeration requirement for the cooling of cryogenic systems introduces serious issues in terms of power dissipation. Gain-cell embedded dynamic random access memory (GC-eDRAM) is a low-area, logic-compatible embedded memory alternative to static random access memory (SRAM), which has the potential to provide ultralow-power operation under cryogenic conditions due to the lower leakages at these temperatures. In this article, we present the first comparative design exploration of GC-eDRAM under cryogenic conditions performed with transistor models characterized based on actual silicon measurements under temperatures as low as 77 K. Our study shows that the two-transistor (2T)-based GC-eDRAM configurations turn out to be the best solutions for very low-temperature operation. In particular, the 2T mixed GC-eDRAM configurations allow read sensing margin improvements (up to 99%) within the 2T-based configurations while at the same time excel in terms of data retention time (+44%) and power consumption (-27%) when compared to more complex GC-eDRAM topologies. Moreover, even better improvements in terms of area (-73%), leakage power (-97%), retention power (-76%), and energy (-66%) are observed when compared to conventional 6T-SRAM."

  abstract: "This paper presents a 1024-bit self-adaptive memory address decoder based on Dual Mode Logic (DML) design style to allow working in two modes of operation (i.e., dynamic for high-performance and static for energy-saving). The main novelty of this work relies on the design of a controlling mechanism that mixes both of these modes of operation to simultaneously benefit from their inherent advantages. When performance is the primary target, the mixed operating mode is enabled, and the self-adjustment mechanism identifies at run time the logic gates that have to work in the energy-efficient mode (i.e., static mode), while those belonging to the critical path operate in the faster dynamic mode. Moreover, our address decoder can run in the fully static mode for the lowest energy consumption when speed is not a primary concern. A 65 nm CMOS technology was exploited to simulate and compare our solution with other logically equivalent dynamic and static designs. Operated in the mixed mode, the proposed circuit exhibits negligible speed reduction (8.7%) in comparison with a dynamic logic based design while presenting significantly reduced energy consumption (28%). On the contrary, further energy is saved (29%) with respect to conventional logic styles when our design runs in its energy efficient mode."

Our study is performed at the bitcell level by considering a DMTJ with two reference layers and exploiting either FinFET or TFET devices as cell selectors. Although ultralow-voltage operation occurs at the expense of reduced reading voltage sensing margins, simulations results show that TFET-based solutions are more resilient to process variations and can operate at ultralow voltages (<0.5 V), while showing energy savings of 50% and faster write switching of 60%."

#   abstract: "Optimal control of turbulent flows requires a detailed prediction of the unsteady, three-dimensional turbulent structures that govern quantities of interest like noise, drag, and mixing efficiency. There is a need for physics-based, reduced-order models of turbulent structure for those cases where direct simulation of the flow would be computationally prohibitive. In this thesis, we explore resolvent analysis as a framework for such models. Based on a linearization about the turbulent mean flow field, the resolvent finds optimal (highest gain) forcing functions that give rise, through linear amplification mechanisms, to energetic coherent structures. The forcing functions represent the nonlinear interactions between the coherent structures as well as with background incoherent turbulence.  While the high-gain structures capture many characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free-shear flows, closures for the forcing function are required to make these models predictive and thus utilize them for flow control.

# In the first part of this thesis, we examine a linear model for the resolvent forcing by adapting the concept of a turbulent (eddy) viscosity from classical Reynolds-Averaged  Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. We present a data-driven approach to identify an optimal eddy-viscosity field that best matches the resolvent prediction to the most energetic coherent structure educed via spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We analyze the specific case of turbulent jets spanning a range of Mach numbers from subsonic to supersonic.  We find the optimal eddy-viscosity field to be effective at matching both the shape and energy distribution of structures. More importantly, we find that calibrated eddy-viscosity fields predicted using standard eddy-viscosity models (utilizing only quantities available from RANS) yield results that are close to optimal.  

# We use the resulting resolvent model together with the high-fidelity data to investigate the full spectrum of amplification mechanisms and coherent structures present in turbulent jets. The addition of a turbulence model provides a clear separation between two established mechanisms in turbulent jets (Kelvin-Helmholtz and Orr) and leads to the identification of a third mechanism known as lift-up. Lift-up becomes the dominant mechanism at low-frequency limits for nonzero azimuthal wavenumbers, generating elongated, streaky structures. We find these streaks to be the most energetic structures in the jet, and that their presence has implications for altering the mean flow and controlling noise.

# Finally, we extend resolvent analysis to that of an acoustic analogy that relates the near-field forcing to the far-field acoustics 100 diameters from the nozzle. We again leverage high-fidelity data to produce an ensemble of realizations of the acoustic field and find that only a few resolvent modes are necessary for reconstruction. Ultimately, we find that a resolvent model based solely upon RANS quantities can reconstruct and predict the peak acoustic field at rank-1 to within 2 decibels for both the supersonic and transonic jets."

#   abstract: "Response modes computed via linear resolvent analysis of a turbulent mean-flow field have been shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free shear flows.  To make such resolvent models predictive, the nonlinear forcing term must be closed. Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of triadic interactions, proposing various source models, or through turbulence modelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the mean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field.  In this study, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We use large-eddy simulation databases for round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic conditions and show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the agreement between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90% agreement at those frequencies where the jet exhibits a low-rank response.  We then consider a fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show that with the calibration of a single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one.  In particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) eddy-viscosity resolvent model, with a single coefficient, provides substantial agreement between SPOD and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies."
