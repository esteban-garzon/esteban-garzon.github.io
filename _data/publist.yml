  abstract: "Real-time genome detection, classification and lineage assignment are critical for efficient tracking of emerging mutations and variants during viral pandemics such as Covid-19. For genomic surveillance to work effectively, each new viral genome sequence must be quickly and accurately associated with an existing viral family (lineage). ViRAL is a hardware-accelerated platform for real-time viral genome lineage assignment based on minhashing and Vision Transformer. Minhashing is a locality sensitive hashing based technique for finding regions of similarity within sequenced genomes. Vision Transformer is a model for image classification that employs a Transformer-like architecture over patches of images. In ViRAL, such image patches are genome fragments extracted from the regions of high similarity. ViRAL is especially efficient in lineage assignment of extremely low quality (or highly ambiguous) genomic data, i.e. when a large fraction of DNA bases are missing in an assembled genome. We implement ViRAL on CPU, GPU and a custom-designed hardware accelerator denoted ACMI. ViRAL assigns newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes to existing lineages with the top-1 accuracy of 94.2%. The probability of the correct assignment to be found among the five most likely placements generated by ViRAL (top-5 accuracy) is 99.8%. Accelerated ViRAL outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art assignment tools by 69.4X. It also outperforms ViRAL GPU implementation by 19.5X. ViRAL strongly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in assigning highly-ambiguous genomes: while state-of-the-art tools fail to assign lineage to genomes with 50% ambiguity, ViRAL achieves 77.6% assignment accuracy. We make ViRAL available to the research community through GitHub."

#   abstract: "Misleading or unnecessary data can have out-sized impacts on the health or accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) models. We present a Bayesian sequential selection method, akin to Bayesian experimental design, that identifies critically important information within a dataset, while ignoring data that is either misleading or brings unnecessary complexity to the surrogate model of choice. Specifically, our method eliminates the phenomena of double descent, where more data leads to worse performance. Our approach has two key features. First, the selection algorithm dynamically couples the chosen model and data. Data is chosen based on its merits towards improving the selected model, rather than being compared strictly against other data. Second, a natural convergence of the method removes the need for dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets. Instead, the selection metric inherently assesses testing and validation error through global statistics of the model. This ensures that key information is never wasted in testing or validation. The method is applied using both Gaussian process regression and deep neural network surrogate models."

#   abstract: "Optimal control of turbulent flows requires a detailed prediction of the unsteady, three-dimensional turbulent structures that govern quantities of interest like noise, drag, and mixing efficiency. There is a need for physics-based, reduced-order models of turbulent structure for those cases where direct simulation of the flow would be computationally prohibitive. In this thesis, we explore resolvent analysis as a framework for such models. Based on a linearization about the turbulent mean flow field, the resolvent finds optimal (highest gain) forcing functions that give rise, through linear amplification mechanisms, to energetic coherent structures. The forcing functions represent the nonlinear interactions between the coherent structures as well as with background incoherent turbulence.  While the high-gain structures capture many characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free-shear flows, closures for the forcing function are required to make these models predictive and thus utilize them for flow control.

# In the first part of this thesis, we examine a linear model for the resolvent forcing by adapting the concept of a turbulent (eddy) viscosity from classical Reynolds-Averaged  Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. We present a data-driven approach to identify an optimal eddy-viscosity field that best matches the resolvent prediction to the most energetic coherent structure educed via spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We analyze the specific case of turbulent jets spanning a range of Mach numbers from subsonic to supersonic.  We find the optimal eddy-viscosity field to be effective at matching both the shape and energy distribution of structures. More importantly, we find that calibrated eddy-viscosity fields predicted using standard eddy-viscosity models (utilizing only quantities available from RANS) yield results that are close to optimal.  

# We use the resulting resolvent model together with the high-fidelity data to investigate the full spectrum of amplification mechanisms and coherent structures present in turbulent jets. The addition of a turbulence model provides a clear separation between two established mechanisms in turbulent jets (Kelvin-Helmholtz and Orr) and leads to the identification of a third mechanism known as lift-up. Lift-up becomes the dominant mechanism at low-frequency limits for nonzero azimuthal wavenumbers, generating elongated, streaky structures. We find these streaks to be the most energetic structures in the jet, and that their presence has implications for altering the mean flow and controlling noise.

# Finally, we extend resolvent analysis to that of an acoustic analogy that relates the near-field forcing to the far-field acoustics 100 diameters from the nozzle. We again leverage high-fidelity data to produce an ensemble of realizations of the acoustic field and find that only a few resolvent modes are necessary for reconstruction. Ultimately, we find that a resolvent model based solely upon RANS quantities can reconstruct and predict the peak acoustic field at rank-1 to within 2 decibels for both the supersonic and transonic jets."

#   abstract: "Response modes computed via linear resolvent analysis of a turbulent mean-flow field have been shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free shear flows.  To make such resolvent models predictive, the nonlinear forcing term must be closed. Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of triadic interactions, proposing various source models, or through turbulence modelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the mean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field.  In this study, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We use large-eddy simulation databases for round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic conditions and show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the agreement between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90% agreement at those frequencies where the jet exhibits a low-rank response.  We then consider a fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show that with the calibration of a single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one.  In particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) eddy-viscosity resolvent model, with a single coefficient, provides substantial agreement between SPOD and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies."

#   abstract: "Energy Diagnostics Investigator for Efficiency Savings (EDIFES) has been developed for scalable data analytics to conduct virtual energy audits on commercial buildings. Built as a software package in R, EDIFES ingests building electricity data and readily available weather data, applying various data analytics to determine building markers, characteristics, and operational tendencies. Through these analyses building systems are identified, including Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and plug load or other equipment, with characteristics such as load and system scheduling. Once building systems have been identified, EDIFES conducts virtual energy audits to diagnose efficiency issues, determines the impact (i.e. return-on-investment or payback) of potential retrofit actions (e.g. reschedulingHVAC to occupied hours or conducting a lighting retrofit). After this stage, it can be used for measurement and verification (M&V) or continuous commissioning. Six buildings are presented in this thesis."
