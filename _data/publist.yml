  abstract: "Real-time genome detection, classification and lineage assignment are critical for 
  efficient tracking of emerging mutations and variants during viral pandemics such as Covid-19.
  For genomic surveillance to work effectively, each new viral genome sequence must be quickly and 
  accurately associated with an existing viral family (lineage). 
  ViRAL is a hardware-accelerated platform for real-time viral genome lineage assignment based on minhashing and Vision Transformer. 
  Minhashing is a locality sensitive hashing based technique for finding regions of similarity within
  sequenced genomes. Vision Transformer is a model for image classification that employs a 
  Transformer-like architecture over patches of images. In ViRAL, such image patches are genome 
  fragments extracted from the regions of high similarity. ViRAL is especially efficient in lineage 
  assignment of extremely low quality (or highly ambiguous) genomic data, i.e. when a large fraction 
  of DNA bases are missing in an assembled genome. We implement ViRAL on CPU, GPU and a custom-designed
  hardware accelerator denoted ACMI. ViRAL assigns newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes to existing 
    lineages with the top-1 accuracy of 94.2%. The probability of the correct assignment to be found 
    among the five most likely placements generated by ViRAL (top-5 accuracy) is 99.8%. Accelerated 
    ViRAL outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art assignment tools by 69.4X. It also outperforms 
    ViRAL GPU implementation by 19.5X. ViRAL strongly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in 
    assigning highly-ambiguous genomes: while state-of-the-art tools fail to assign lineage to genomes 
    with 50% ambiguity, ViRAL achieves 77.6% assignment accuracy. We make ViRAL available to the research 
    community through GitHub."

  abstract: "Content addressable memories (CAMs) are widely used in many applications in general purpose computer microarchitecture, networking and domain-specific hardware accelerators. In addition to storing and reading data, CAMs enable simultaneous compare of query datawords with the entire memory content. Similar to SRAM and DRAM, CAMs are prone to errors and faults. While error correcting codes (ECCs) are widely used in DRAM and SRAM, they are not directly applicable in CAM: if a dataword that is supposed to match a query altered due to an error, it will falsely mismatch even if it is ECC-encoded. We propose OCCAM, an error oblivious CAM, which combines ECC and approximate search (matching) to allow tolerating a large and dynamically configurable number of errors. We manufactured the OCCAM silicon prototype using 65-nm commercial process and verified its error tolerance capabilities through silicon measurements. OCCAM tolerates 11% error rate (7 bit errors in each 64-bit memory row) with 100% sensitivity and specificity."

  abstract: "Associative access is widely used in fundamental microarchitectural components, such as caches and TLBs. However, associative (or content addressable) memories (CAMs) have been traditionally considered too large, too energy-hungry, and not scalable, and therefore, have limited use in modern computer microarchitecture. This work revisits these presumptions and proposes an energy-efficient fully-associative tag array (FASTA) architecture, based on a novel complementary CAM (CCAM) bitcell. CCAM offers a full CMOS solution for CAM, removing the need for time- and energy-consuming precharge and combining the speed of NOR CAM and low energy consumption of NAND CAM. While providing better performance and energy consumption, CCAM features a larger area compared to state-of-the-art CAM designs. We further show how FASTA can be used to construct a novel aliasing-free, energy-efficient, Very-Many-Way Associative (VMWA) cache. Circuit-level simulations using 16 nm FinFET technology show that a 128 kB FASTA-based 256-way 8-set associative cache is 28% faster and consumes 88% less energy-per-access than a same sized 8-way (256-set) SRAM based cache, while also providing aliasing-free operation. System-level evaluation performed on the Sniper simulator shows that the VMWA cache exhibits lower Misses Per Kilo Instructions (MPKI) for the majority of benchmarks. Specifically, the 256-way associative cache achieves 17.3%, 11.5%, and 1.2% lower average MPKI for L1, L2, and L3 caches, respectively, compared to a 16-way associative cache. The average IPC improvement for L1, L2, and L3 caches are 1.6%, 1.4%, and 0.2%, respectively."

#   abstract: "Optimal control of turbulent flows requires a detailed prediction of the unsteady, three-dimensional turbulent structures that govern quantities of interest like noise, drag, and mixing efficiency. There is a need for physics-based, reduced-order models of turbulent structure for those cases where direct simulation of the flow would be computationally prohibitive. In this thesis, we explore resolvent analysis as a framework for such models. Based on a linearization about the turbulent mean flow field, the resolvent finds optimal (highest gain) forcing functions that give rise, through linear amplification mechanisms, to energetic coherent structures. The forcing functions represent the nonlinear interactions between the coherent structures as well as with background incoherent turbulence.  While the high-gain structures capture many characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free-shear flows, closures for the forcing function are required to make these models predictive and thus utilize them for flow control.

# In the first part of this thesis, we examine a linear model for the resolvent forcing by adapting the concept of a turbulent (eddy) viscosity from classical Reynolds-Averaged  Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. We present a data-driven approach to identify an optimal eddy-viscosity field that best matches the resolvent prediction to the most energetic coherent structure educed via spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We analyze the specific case of turbulent jets spanning a range of Mach numbers from subsonic to supersonic.  We find the optimal eddy-viscosity field to be effective at matching both the shape and energy distribution of structures. More importantly, we find that calibrated eddy-viscosity fields predicted using standard eddy-viscosity models (utilizing only quantities available from RANS) yield results that are close to optimal.  

# We use the resulting resolvent model together with the high-fidelity data to investigate the full spectrum of amplification mechanisms and coherent structures present in turbulent jets. The addition of a turbulence model provides a clear separation between two established mechanisms in turbulent jets (Kelvin-Helmholtz and Orr) and leads to the identification of a third mechanism known as lift-up. Lift-up becomes the dominant mechanism at low-frequency limits for nonzero azimuthal wavenumbers, generating elongated, streaky structures. We find these streaks to be the most energetic structures in the jet, and that their presence has implications for altering the mean flow and controlling noise.

# Finally, we extend resolvent analysis to that of an acoustic analogy that relates the near-field forcing to the far-field acoustics 100 diameters from the nozzle. We again leverage high-fidelity data to produce an ensemble of realizations of the acoustic field and find that only a few resolvent modes are necessary for reconstruction. Ultimately, we find that a resolvent model based solely upon RANS quantities can reconstruct and predict the peak acoustic field at rank-1 to within 2 decibels for both the supersonic and transonic jets."

#   abstract: "Response modes computed via linear resolvent analysis of a turbulent mean-flow field have been shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free shear flows.  To make such resolvent models predictive, the nonlinear forcing term must be closed. Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of triadic interactions, proposing various source models, or through turbulence modelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the mean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field.  In this study, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We use large-eddy simulation databases for round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic conditions and show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the agreement between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90% agreement at those frequencies where the jet exhibits a low-rank response.  We then consider a fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show that with the calibration of a single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one.  In particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) eddy-viscosity resolvent model, with a single coefficient, provides substantial agreement between SPOD and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies."

#   abstract: "Energy Diagnostics Investigator for Efficiency Savings (EDIFES) has been developed for scalable data analytics to conduct virtual energy audits on commercial buildings. Built as a software package in R, EDIFES ingests building electricity data and readily available weather data, applying various data analytics to determine building markers, characteristics, and operational tendencies. Through these analyses building systems are identified, including Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and plug load or other equipment, with characteristics such as load and system scheduling. Once building systems have been identified, EDIFES conducts virtual energy audits to diagnose efficiency issues, determines the impact (i.e. return-on-investment or payback) of potential retrofit actions (e.g. reschedulingHVAC to occupied hours or conducting a lighting retrofit). After this stage, it can be used for measurement and verification (M&V) or continuous commissioning. Six buildings are presented in this thesis."
