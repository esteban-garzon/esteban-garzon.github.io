  abstract: "Probabilistic computing with p-bits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning
and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising
machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the
random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled p-bits, and the energy
minimization algorithm. Regarding the latter, in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated
quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing
and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems,
planted Ising problem, and travelling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the
architecture of a fully connected CMOS-based PIM able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-
update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA
increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an
algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with
different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are
hardware-agnostic and can be applied in the co-design of any hybrid analog-digital Ising machine
implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation
of reliable and scalable PIMs."

  abstract: "Dynamic comparators play an important role in electronic systems, requiring high accuracy, low power consumption, and minimal offset voltage. This work proposes an accurate and low-complexity offset calibration design based on a capacitive load approach. It was designed using a 65nm CMOS technology and comprehensively evaluated under Monte Carlo simulations and PVT variations. The proposed scheme was built using MIM capacitors and transistor-based capacitors, and includes Verilog-based calibration algorithms. The proposed offset calibration is benchmarked, in terms of precision, calibration time, energy consumption, delay, and area, against prior calibration techniques: current injection via gate biasing by a charge pump circuit, and current injection via parallel transistors. The evaluation of the offset calibration schemes relies on Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) simulations, ensuring accurate evaluation of digital and analog domains. The charge pump method achieved the best Energy-Delay Product (EDP) at the cost of lower long-term accuracy, mainly because of its capacitor leakage. The proposed scheme demonstrated superior performance in offset reduction, achieving a 1-sigma offset of 0.223mV, while maintaining precise calibration. Among the calibration algorithms, the window algorithm performs better than the accelerated calibration.
  This is mainly because the window algorithm considers noise-induced output oscillations, ensuring consistent calibration across all designs. 
  This work provides insights into the trade-offs between energy, precision, and area in dynamic comparator designs, offering strategies to enhance offset calibration."

State-of-the-art CAM solutions are either fast but power-hungry (NOR CAM) or slow while consuming less power (NAND CAM). 
These limitations stem from the dynamic precharge operation, leading to excessive power consumption in NOR CAMs and charge-sharing issues in NAND CAMs.
In this work, we propose a precharge-free CAM (PCAM) class for energy-efficient applications. By avoiding precharge operation, PCAM consumes less energy than a NAND CAM, while achieving search speed comparable to a NOR CAM.
PCAM was designed using a 65nm CMOS technology and comprehensively evaluated under extensive Monte Carlo simulations, while taking into account layout parasitics.
When benchmarked against conventional NAND CAM, PCAM demonstrates improved search run time (reduced by more than 30%) and 15% less search energy. 
Moreover, PCAM can cut energy consumption by more than 75% as compared to conventional NOR CAM.
We further extend our analysis to the application level, functionally evaluating the CAM designs as a fully-associative cache using a CPU simulator running various benchmark workloads.
This analysis confirms that PCAMs represent an optimal energy-performance design choice for associative memories and their broad spectrum of applications."

  abstract: "Real-time genome detection, classification and lineage assignment are critical for efficient tracking of emerging mutations and variants during viral pandemics such as Covid-19. For genomic surveillance to work effectively, each new viral genome sequence must be quickly and accurately associated with an existing viral family (lineage). ViRAL is a hardware-accelerated platform for real-time viral genome lineage assignment based on minhashing and Vision Transformer.  Minhashing is a locality sensitive hashing based technique for finding regions of similarity within sequenced genomes. Vision Transformer is a model for image classification that employs a Transformer-like architecture over patches of images. In ViRAL, such image patches are genome 
  fragments extracted from the regions of high similarity. ViRAL is especially efficient in lineage assignment of extremely low quality (or highly ambiguous) genomic data, i.e. when a large fraction of DNA bases are missing in an assembled genome. We implement ViRAL on CPU, GPU and a custom-designed hardware accelerator denoted ACMI. ViRAL assigns newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes to existing lineages with the top-1 accuracy of 94.2%. The probability of the correct assignment to be found 
    among the five most likely placements generated by ViRAL (top-5 accuracy) is 99.8%. Accelerated ViRAL outperforms the fastest state-of-the-art assignment tools by 69.4X. It also outperforms ViRAL GPU implementation by 19.5X. ViRAL strongly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in assigning highly-ambiguous genomes: while state-of-the-art tools fail to assign lineage to genomes with 50% ambiguity, ViRAL achieves 77.6% assignment accuracy. We make ViRAL available to the research community through GitHub."

  abstract: "Content addressable memories (CAMs) are widely used in many applications in general purpose computer microarchitecture, networking and domain-specific hardware accelerators. In addition to storing and reading data, CAMs enable simultaneous compare of query datawords with the entire memory content. Similar to SRAM and DRAM, CAMs are prone to errors and faults. While error correcting codes (ECCs) are widely used in DRAM and SRAM, they are not directly applicable in CAM: if a dataword that is supposed to match a query altered due to an error, it will falsely mismatch even if it is ECC-encoded. We propose OCCAM, an error oblivious CAM, which combines ECC and approximate search (matching) to allow tolerating a large and dynamically configurable number of errors. We manufactured the OCCAM silicon prototype using 65-nm commercial process and verified its error tolerance capabilities through silicon measurements. OCCAM tolerates 11% error rate (7 bit errors in each 64-bit memory row) with 100% sensitivity and specificity."

  abstract: "Associative access is widely used in fundamental microarchitectural components, such as caches and TLBs. However, associative (or content addressable) memories (CAMs) have been traditionally considered too large, too energy-hungry, and not scalable, and therefore, have limited use in modern computer microarchitecture. This work revisits these presumptions and proposes an energy-efficient fully-associative tag array (FASTA) architecture, based on a novel complementary CAM (CCAM) bitcell. CCAM offers a full CMOS solution for CAM, removing the need for time- and energy-consuming precharge and combining the speed of NOR CAM and low energy consumption of NAND CAM. While providing better performance and energy consumption, CCAM features a larger area compared to state-of-the-art CAM designs. We further show how FASTA can be used to construct a novel aliasing-free, energy-efficient, Very-Many-Way Associative (VMWA) cache. Circuit-level simulations using 16 nm FinFET technology show that a 128 kB FASTA-based 256-way 8-set associative cache is 28% faster and consumes 88% less energy-per-access than a same sized 8-way (256-set) SRAM based cache, while also providing aliasing-free operation. System-level evaluation performed on the Sniper simulator shows that the VMWA cache exhibits lower Misses Per Kilo Instructions (MPKI) for the majority of benchmarks. Specifically, the 256-way associative cache achieves 17.3%, 11.5%, and 1.2% lower average MPKI for L1, L2, and L3 caches, respectively, compared to a 16-way associative cache. The average IPC improvement for L1, L2, and L3 caches are 1.6%, 1.4%, and 0.2%, respectively."

  abstract: "This paper introduces SIMPLY+, an advanced Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic Random-Access Memory (STT-MRAM)-based Logic-in-Memory (LIM) architecture that evolves from the previously proposed smart material implication (SIMPLY) logic scheme. More specifically, the latter is enhanced by incorporating additional circuitry to enhance the reliability of preliminary read operations. In this study, the proposed architecture is benchmarked against its conventional counterpart. Obtained results show a significant improvement in terms of reliability, i.e., the nominal read margin (RM) by a factor of about 3−4X and accordingly the bit error rate (BER) by more than four orders of magnitude. These improvements come at minimal cost in terms of circuit area and complexity compared to the conventional SIMPLY design. Overall, this research establishes SIMPLY+ as a promising solution for the design of reliable and energy-efficient in-memory computing architectures."

  abstract: "We design a spintronic physical unclonable function (PUF) based on sub-100nm voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy hybrid magnetic tunnel junctions (VCMA-MTJs). This complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor VCMA-MTJ (CMOS/VCMA-MTJ) PUF architecture was evaluated by combining micromagnetic simulations, Verilog-A modeling, and circuit-level simulations. The PUF architecture, comprising four 16x16 columns arrays, demonstrates effective read and write operations using conventional voltage sensing that are orders of magnitudes lower than previous spintronic-based PUFs.

  abstract: "We propose a novel dynamic storage-based approximate search content addressable memory (DASH-CAM) for computational genomics applications, particularly for identification and classification of viral pathogens of epidemic significance. DASH-CAM provides 5.5 × better density compared to state-of-the-art SRAM-based approximate search CAM. This allows using DASH-CAM as a portable classifier that can be applied to pathogen surveillance in low-quality field settings during pandemics, as well as to pathogen diagnostics at points of care. DASH-CAM approximate search capabilities allow a high level of flexibility when dealing with a variety of industrial sequencers with different error profiles. DASH-CAM achieves up to 30% and 20% higher F1 score when classifying DNA reads with 10% error rate, compared to state-of-the-art DNA classification tools MetaCache-GPU and Kraken2 respectively. Simulated at 1GHz, DASH-CAM provides 1,178× and 1,040× average speedup over MetaCache-GPU and Kraken2 respectively."

  abstract: "The need for approximate rather than exact search arises in numerous compare-intensive applications, from networking to computational genomics. This brief presents a novel sensing approach for approximate matching content-addressable memory (CAM) designed to handle large Hamming distances (HDs) between the query pattern and stored data. The proposed matchline sensing scheme (MLSS) employs a replica mechanism and a 12-transistor positive feedback sense amplifier to effectively resolve the approximate match operation. The MLSS was integrated into a 4 kB approximate CAM array and fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS technology. With an overall area footprint of 0.0048 mm2, which includes 512 sense amplifiers and the replica mechanism, the MLSS allows a flexible and dynamic adjustment of the HD tolerance threshold via several design variables. Experimental measurements demonstrate the efficiency of our sensing scheme in tolerating very large HDs with the highest sensitivity."

  abstract: "Multi-ported memories are widely used in many applications, such as for high-speed and high-performance parallel computations. While conventional SRAM-based memory macros are limited in both flexibility (e.g., to accommodate a large number of write inputs and read outputs) and performance, standard cell-based memories are much more flexible and can be parameterized. The physical implementation approaches of the existing tools have great difficulty in dealing with these memories due to the multiplicity of wiring and misunderstanding of the regular structure of these arrays, to the point of inability to converge under certain conditions. This paper presents novel methodologies for the logical and physical implementation of many-ported standard cell memories (MPSCMs). Two methodologies are proposed to replace the standard design flow by controlling and guiding the design tools to improve power consumption, area and performance of these arrays. A commercial 65 nm CMOS technology was used to evaluate and benchmark the two design methodologies on MPSCM macros of different sizes as compared to other equivalent macros designed with standard methodologies and state-of-the-art designs. Physical implementation results show that as compared to a standard RTL approach, the implementation of a 3-write, 5-read port (3W5R) register file with the tightly-controlled methodology leads a 2X increase in placement density along with significant reductions in write power (–66%), read power (–37%) and leakage power (–80%), while also improving the access time (–6%). When considering an extreme case of a many-ported memory with 20-write and 20-read ports (20W/20R), the guided methodology leads to improvements in delay (–13%), write power (–62%), and leakage power (–51%). Both methodologies were implemented within an automation utility based on the “Salamandra” open source netlisting tool, enabling fast and easy migration to additional process nodes and standard cell libraries for generating MPSCMs with various sizes and features."

  abstract: "This work explores non-volatile (NV) embedded memories implemented by spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memories (STT-MRAMs). Our designs are based on state-of-the-art perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) along with a commercial 65 nm planar CMOS Bulk technology node, both operating at the liquid nitrogen temperature, 77 K. We evaluate the impact of cooling down to 77 K of the STT-MRAMs based on single- and double-barrier MTJ (SMTJ and DMTJ), and DMTJ with the relaxed non-volatility. All NV designs were benchmarked against the six-transistor SRAM (6T-SRAM) baseline. Simulation analysis relies on a 512 kB cache memory operating at 77 K. Overall, results show that the implementation of STT-MRAMs with DMTJ devices, and in particular when using the non-volatility approach by reducing the cross-section area, excel in terms of energy consumption, leading to energy savings for write/read access of about 35%/54%. This saving is obtained while also dissipating less leakage power and requiring a smaller bitcell footprint. Moreover, it presents reduced write latency overhead (as much as 1.9× lower), at the expense of increased read latency and reduced sensing margins of about 1.8× and 88%, respectively. The results suggest that STT-MRAM technology can be a solid alternative for energy-efficient cryogenic memory applications."

  abstract: "The unique ability of dual-mode logic (DML) to self-adapt to computational needs by providing high speed and/or low-energy consumption is demonstrated for the first time for exact or approximate operations suitable for both error-resilient and exact applications. At the gate level, the DML design offers the possibility to operate either in the static mode to save energy or in the dynamic mode to increase speed, albeit with higher delay or energy consumption, respectively. In this paper, these two operation modes of the DML gates are optimally managed by a self-adjustment mechanism to increase speed or reduce the energy at run time, while changing the design accuracy. As a test case, a DML Carry Look Ahead adder (CLA) based in Dual Mode Logic (DML) that can operate in exact and approximate mode with the same frequency has been proposed. Through comparisons with CMOS-based alternative at various operating voltages, the advantages of the ADMLCLA are showcased. In static mode, the ADML-CLA presents less energy consumption of about 16% to 21%. In mixed mode, the ADML-CLA achieves delay reduction of 21% to 25%. The effectiveness of the controller in saving energy is demonstrated, with the ADML-CLA consuming less energy than CMOS when static signals are prevalent. Monte Carlo simulations highlight the lower average delay and deviation of the ADML-CLA compared to CMOS. Evaluation at a nominal voltage of 0.4V shows that the ADML (mixed) outperforms CMOS in terms of energy-delay product (EDP) in both exact and approximate modes."

  abstract: "Content-addressable memory (CAM) has been part of the memory market for more than five decades. CAM can carry out a single clock cycle lookup based on the content rather than an address. Thanks to this attractive feature, CAM is utilized in memory systems where a high-speed content lookup technique is required. However, typical CAM applications only support exact matching, as opposed to approximate matching, where a certain Hamming distance (several mismatching characters between a query pattern and the dataset stored in CAM) needs to be tolerated. Recent interest in approximate search has led to the development of new CAM-based alternatives, accelerating the processing of large data workloads in the realm of big data, genomics, and other data-intensive applications. In this review, we provide an overview of approximate CAM and describe its current and potential applications that would benefit from approximate search computing."

These are then used to define two oscillation frequencies, whose ratio is proportional to absolute-temperature. Finally, the sensor back-end translates such frequency ratio into the digital temperature code. Thanks to its low-complexity architecture, the proposed design achieves a very compact footprint along with low-power consumption and high accuracy in a wide temperature range. Moreover, thanks to a simple embedded line regulation mechanism, our sensor supports voltage-scalability.

  abstract: "Miniaturization and portable devices have reshaped the electronic device landscape, emphasizing the importance of high performance while maintaining energy efficiency to ensure long battery life. FinFET and Tunnel-FET technologies have emerged as attractive alternatives to overcome the limitations of supply voltage scaling for ultra-low power applications. This work compares the performance of 10 nm FinFET- and TFET-based digital circuits from basic logic gates up to an 8k gates low-power microprocessor. When compared with their FinFET-based counterparts, the TFET-based logic gates have lower leakage power when operated below 300 mV, show higher input capacitance, and exhibit a reduced propagation delay under different fan-in and fan-out conditions. Our comparative study was extended to the synthesis of an MSP-430 microprocessor through standard cell libraries built particularly for this work. It is demonstrated that the TFET-based synthesized circuits operating at ultra-low voltages achieve a higher performance in terms of speed at the cost of increased power consumption. When the speed requirements are relaxed, the TFET-based designs are the most energy-efficient alternative. It is concluded that the TFET is an optimal solution for ultra-low voltage design."

  abstract: "This work presents an associative in-memory deep learning processor (AIDA) for edge devices. An associative processor is a massively parallel non-von Neumann accelerator that uses memory cells for computing; the bulk of data is never transferred outside the memory arrays for external processing. AIDA utilizes a dynamic content addressable memory for both data storage and processing, and benefits from sparsity and limited arithmetic precision, typical in modern deep neural networks. The novel in-data processing implementation designed for the AIDA accelerator achieves a speedup of 270X over an advanced central processing unit at more than three orders-of-magnitude better energy efficiency."

  abstract: "This paper investigates the impact of thermal stability relaxation in double-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (DMTJs) for energy-efficient spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memories (STT-MRAMs) operating at the liquid nitrogen boiling point (77 K). Our study is carried out through a macrospin-based Verilog-A compact model of DMTJ, along with a 65 nm commercial process design kit (PDK) calibrated down to 77 K under silicon measurements. Comprehensive bitcell-level electrical characterization is used to estimate the energy/latency per operation and leakage power at the memory architecture-level. As a main result of our analysis, we show that energy-efficient small-to-large embedded memories can be obtained by significantly relaxing the non-volatility requirement of DMTJ devices at room temperature (i.e., by reducing the cross-section area), while maintaining the typical 10-years retention time at cryogenic temperatures. This makes DMTJ-based STT-MRAM operating at 77 K more energy-efficient than six-transistors static random-access memory (6T-SRAM) under both read and write accesses (−56% and −37% on average, respectively). Obtained results thus prove that DMTJ-based STT-MRAM with relaxed retention time is a promising alternative for the realization of reliable and energy-efficient embedded memories operating at cryogenic temperatures."

  abstract: "Ever since the emergence of the electrical computer and the Von Neumann model, computer architects have adhered to a well-structured hierarchy of memory solutions, clearly trading off performance and capacity with cost. The ubiquitous memory technologies, dominated by SRAM, DRAM, Flash, and magnetic hard disks, are each situated in a well-defined location within this hierarchy. However, as processes have scaled into deep nanometer feature sizes and the demand for larger capacities and bandwidths increases, these traditional options face tough challenges and may be limited in their ability to continue to provide the new requirements. New technologies, such as phase change memory (PCM), magnetic RAM (MRAM), and resistive RAM (RRAM), have been researched and developed over the recent past in an attempt to meet these demands and replace some or all of the traditional technologies. In this article, the primary technologies are overviewed, including those that currently fill the memory hierarchy pyramid, the primary candidates to join or replace them in the near-term, and a number of newer candidates that may arise as legitimate solutions in the farther term. In addition, an overview of the current state of processing within the emerging memory technologies is provided, as an attempt to break free of the traditional Von Neumann paradigm to overcome the energy and performance bottlenecks in modern systems."

  abstract: "The ever-growing interest in cryogenic applications has prompted the investigation for energy-efficient and high-density memory technologies that are able to operate efficiently at extremely low temperatures. This work analyzes three appealing embedded memory technologies under cooling—from room temperature (300 K) down to cryogenic levels (77 K). As the temperature goes down to 77 K, six-transistor static random-access memory (6T-SRAM) presents slight improvements for static noise margin (SNM) during hold and read operations, while suffering from lower (−16%) write SNM. Gain-cell embedded DRAM (GC-eDRAM) shows significant benefits under these conditions, with read voltage margins and data retention time improved by about 2× and 900×, respectively. Non-volatile spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) based on single- or double-barrier magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) exhibit higher read voltage sensing margins (36% and 48%, respectively), at the cost of longer write access time (1.45X and 2.1X, respectively). The above characteristics make the considered memory technologies to be attractive candidates not only for high-performance computing, but also enable the possibility to bridge the gap from room-temperature to the realm of cryogenic applications that operate down to liquid helium temperatures and below."

The proposed sensor was fabricated in 180-nm CMOS technology. When powered at 350 mV, it can achieve an energy/conversion of 0.46 nJ in a conversion time of 33 ms.

  abstract: "Operating circuits under cryogenic conditions is effective for a large spectrum of applications. However, the refrigeration requirement for the cooling of cryogenic systems introduces serious issues in terms of power dissipation. Gain-cell embedded dynamic random access memory (GC-eDRAM) is a low-area, logic-compatible embedded memory alternative to static random access memory (SRAM), which has the potential to provide ultralow-power operation under cryogenic conditions due to the lower leakages at these temperatures. In this article, we present the first comparative design exploration of GC-eDRAM under cryogenic conditions performed with transistor models characterized based on actual silicon measurements under temperatures as low as 77 K. Our study shows that the two-transistor (2T)-based GC-eDRAM configurations turn out to be the best solutions for very low-temperature operation. In particular, the 2T mixed GC-eDRAM configurations allow read sensing margin improvements (up to 99%) within the 2T-based configurations while at the same time excel in terms of data retention time (+44%) and power consumption (-27%) when compared to more complex GC-eDRAM topologies. Moreover, even better improvements in terms of area (-73%), leakage power (-97%), retention power (-76%), and energy (-66%) are observed when compared to conventional 6T-SRAM."

  abstract: "This paper presents a 1024-bit self-adaptive memory address decoder based on Dual Mode Logic (DML) design style to allow working in two modes of operation (i.e., dynamic for high-performance and static for energy-saving). The main novelty of this work relies on the design of a controlling mechanism that mixes both of these modes of operation to simultaneously benefit from their inherent advantages. When performance is the primary target, the mixed operating mode is enabled, and the self-adjustment mechanism identifies at run time the logic gates that have to work in the energy-efficient mode (i.e., static mode), while those belonging to the critical path operate in the faster dynamic mode. Moreover, our address decoder can run in the fully static mode for the lowest energy consumption when speed is not a primary concern. A 65 nm CMOS technology was exploited to simulate and compare our solution with other logically equivalent dynamic and static designs. Operated in the mixed mode, the proposed circuit exhibits negligible speed reduction (8.7%) in comparison with a dynamic logic based design while presenting significantly reduced energy consumption (28%). On the contrary, further energy is saved (29%) with respect to conventional logic styles when our design runs in its energy efficient mode."

Additionally, STT-MTJ based circuits have shown attractive potential to design efficient non-volatile logic-in-memory (NV-LIM) architectures, which assure low power and increased speed. This paper proposes a bit-level reconfigurable NV logic circuit based on hybrid CMOS/STT-MTJ design. Indeed, our circuit can adapt on-demand its structure, thus offering intrinsic flexibility to perform basic logic functions (i.e. AND/OR/XOR) by a single circuit architecture. Post-layout simulation results prove that the proposed circuit leads to increase both delay and energy consumption with respect to state-of-the-art non-reconfigurable designs. However, its reconfigurable operation capability is very attractive to reduce area occupation and to increase design flexibility of NV-LIM systems."

Owing to the reduced switching current, DMTJ-based STT-MRAMs prove to be credible candidates for next-generation non-volatile cache memories."

RFCV is a technique that permits the measurement of capacitances from devices with an oxide thickness up into the nanometric range.

  abstract: "As part of a larger scope work that studies network-based positioning, that employs timing measures, this article proposes a methodology to add Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRBs) information to the propagation model. Moreover, it enables a very quick computation of CRBs for timing, avoiding the growing computational effort resulting from Fisher's matrix formulation and its inversion for each required position at the simulation stage, assuring at the same time the reliability of the required data in the study of positioning using space-time diversity. This methodology considers the variability of the propagation conditions in terms of delay spread (DS) and Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) in a realistic scenario. It also coordinates the operation of concurrent models within simulation, and finally performs bi-exponential regression and interpolation procedures on pertinent operational regions for CRBs. Properly validated models provide simple closed expressions that ease the operational region discrimination and its integration to the positioning simulation platform."

First of all, this work discusses the positioning problem based on measures of Time Differences Of Arrival departing from a more exact characterization of the signal statistics and including some geometrical restrictions to achieve an improved accurate. Furthermore, a novel approach that integrates signal propagation characteristics to information provided by a suitable timing estimation model based on Cramer Rao Bound for a Rayleigh-fading channel, when antenna arrays are used at the receiver and when a set of channel vector estimates are available, has been introduced to study the positive benefits of space-time diversity. These approaches are evaluated within a realistic simulation scenario."

Such technic is fundamental to measure and extract capacitances from nanometric range oxide thickness, which are very leaky in low frequency range measurements. This method uses the control and synchronization of a vector network analyzer (VNA) with a Source Measure Unit (SMU) from a parameter analyzer (PA). The control is established by a remote graphical interface developed in Python. It includes the use of standards like IEEE 488.2, SCPI and Ethernet link protocol. For the RFCV measurements, the SMU provides the DC voltage whereas the VNA the RF signal."

#   abstract: "Optimal control of turbulent flows requires a detailed prediction of the unsteady, three-dimensional turbulent structures that govern quantities of interest like noise, drag, and mixing efficiency. There is a need for physics-based, reduced-order models of turbulent structure for those cases where direct simulation of the flow would be computationally prohibitive. In this thesis, we explore resolvent analysis as a framework for such models. Based on a linearization about the turbulent mean flow field, the resolvent finds optimal (highest gain) forcing functions that give rise, through linear amplification mechanisms, to energetic coherent structures. The forcing functions represent the nonlinear interactions between the coherent structures as well as with background incoherent turbulence.  While the high-gain structures capture many characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free-shear flows, closures for the forcing function are required to make these models predictive and thus utilize them for flow control.

# In the first part of this thesis, we examine a linear model for the resolvent forcing by adapting the concept of a turbulent (eddy) viscosity from classical Reynolds-Averaged  Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. We present a data-driven approach to identify an optimal eddy-viscosity field that best matches the resolvent prediction to the most energetic coherent structure educed via spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We analyze the specific case of turbulent jets spanning a range of Mach numbers from subsonic to supersonic.  We find the optimal eddy-viscosity field to be effective at matching both the shape and energy distribution of structures. More importantly, we find that calibrated eddy-viscosity fields predicted using standard eddy-viscosity models (utilizing only quantities available from RANS) yield results that are close to optimal.  

# We use the resulting resolvent model together with the high-fidelity data to investigate the full spectrum of amplification mechanisms and coherent structures present in turbulent jets. The addition of a turbulence model provides a clear separation between two established mechanisms in turbulent jets (Kelvin-Helmholtz and Orr) and leads to the identification of a third mechanism known as lift-up. Lift-up becomes the dominant mechanism at low-frequency limits for nonzero azimuthal wavenumbers, generating elongated, streaky structures. We find these streaks to be the most energetic structures in the jet, and that their presence has implications for altering the mean flow and controlling noise.

# Finally, we extend resolvent analysis to that of an acoustic analogy that relates the near-field forcing to the far-field acoustics 100 diameters from the nozzle. We again leverage high-fidelity data to produce an ensemble of realizations of the acoustic field and find that only a few resolvent modes are necessary for reconstruction. Ultimately, we find that a resolvent model based solely upon RANS quantities can reconstruct and predict the peak acoustic field at rank-1 to within 2 decibels for both the supersonic and transonic jets."

#   abstract: "Response modes computed via linear resolvent analysis of a turbulent mean-flow field have been shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free shear flows.  To make such resolvent models predictive, the nonlinear forcing term must be closed. Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of triadic interactions, proposing various source models, or through turbulence modelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the mean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field.  In this study, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data from high-fidelity simulations.  We use large-eddy simulation databases for round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic conditions and show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the agreement between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90% agreement at those frequencies where the jet exhibits a low-rank response.  We then consider a fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show that with the calibration of a single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one.  In particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS) eddy-viscosity resolvent model, with a single coefficient, provides substantial agreement between SPOD and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies."

Built as a software package in R, EDIFES ingests building electricity data and readily available weather data, applying various data analytics to determine building markers, characteristics, and operational tendencies. Through these analyses building systems are identified, including Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting, and plug load or other equipment, with characteristics such as load and system scheduling. Once building systems have been identified, EDIFES conducts virtual energy audits to diagnose efficiency issues, determines the impact (i.e. return-on-investment or payback) of potential retrofit actions (e.g. reschedulingHVAC to occupied hours or conducting a lighting retrofit). After this stage, it can be used for measurement and verification (M&V) or continuous commissioning. Six buildings are presented in this thesis."
